			<p><span class="firstCap">I</span>n 2040 there will be about 130,000 more seniors living in New York City than today. They will largely depend on public and affordable housing to make up for their inevitable loss of income and the city's inevitable rising rent prices. In south east Queens, where Hurricane Sandy flooded significant numbers of senior housing buildings, some repairs are just being made after twelve years of damage.

			<span class="firstCap">T</span>his October, the Allen Cathedral Senior Residence received a much needed check from New York City countil members to repair one of their elevators. Flooding from the hurricane ruined the elevator's wiring, causing years of malfuntioning until it became completely inoperable. </p>

			<p>
			<span class="firstCap">F</span>or seniors, elevators are not a luxury, they're a necessity. In senior centers without a functioning elevator, “it’s almost a home confinement,” said Chris Marino, vice president of modernization at Centennial Elevator Industries, Inc. His company took over after previous efforts failed to finish the job.
			</p>

      <p>
			<span class="firstCap">I</span>n light of the projected growth in senior population, the twelve years it took to repair Allen's elevators indicates the city is not prepared for the future. The number of Queens residents over 65 will jump from 12.8 percent to 15.6 percent by 2040, outpacing all but Manhattan and Staten Island. If they live above the first floor, they'll need working elevators. </p>

			<span class="firstCap">P</span>er the department of buildings, of the hundreds of buildings taken by Sandy, over 60 percent were in Queens. The storm flooded an area twice the size floodplain maps predicted. If the city hopes to accommodate its most vulnerable, it will need to invest significantly in public and affordable housing, keeping pace with an aging population - and the changing climate they'll be facing. </p>
