They will largely depend on public and affordable housing to make up for their inevitable loss of income and the city's inevitable rising rent prices. In south east Queens, where Hurricane Sandy flooded a significant number of senior housing buildings, some repairs are just being made after twelve years of damage.

In senior centers without one that works, “it’s almost a home confinement,” said Chris Marino, vice president of modernization at Centennial Elevator Industries, Inc. His company took over after previous efforts failed to finish the job.

By 2040, the number of Queens residents over 65 will jump from 12.8 percent to 15.6 percent, outpacing all but Manhattan and Staten Island.  </p>

The storm flooded an area twice the size floodplain maps predicted. For future storms, if the city hopes to protect its most vulnerable, they'll need working elevators. </p>
